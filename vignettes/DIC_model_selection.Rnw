This tutorial shows how to use the R package phylomap to calculate DIC< deviance information criterion, for a tree with 70 tips. To get started, install the phylomap R package from GitHub. 
\begin{verbatim}
> install.packages("devtools")
> library(devtools)
> install_github("phylomap")
\end{verbatim}

Start R and load the needed libraries.

\caption{Model selection results for simulated data on a 70 tip tree. We simulated 40 data sets from 4 different models, ten from a 2-state model of evolution with the root fixed in state 1 (red circles), ten from a 4-state model of evolution with the root fixed in state 1 (red triangles), ten from a 2-state model of evolution with the root not fixed (blue circles), and ten from a 4-state model of evolution with the root not fixed (blue triangles). The number of times each model selection procedure selected the correct model is plotted on the y-axis. We analyzed all 40 data sets with DIC using three different priors and we analyzed the 20 data sets with the root not fixed using corHMM's AIC. }
